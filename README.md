** Build and Run the Application  **

From the project root directory, run the following command to build and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build

This command will build the Docker images for the Flask application and PostgreSQL database, 
create containers for each service, and start the application. You should be able to access the 
Flask application at http://localhost:5000.
